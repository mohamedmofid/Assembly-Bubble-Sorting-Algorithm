# Assembly Bubble Sorting Algorithm

This Assembly program demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using x86 Assembly Language. The program sorts a sample array and displays the sorted elements.

## Overview

This program showcases the functionality of the Bubble Sort algorithm in the Assembly language. The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple comparison-based sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the entire list is sorted.

## Code Structure

- **Bubble Sort Logic**: The heart of the program lies in the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using x86 Assembly Language.
- **Array Initialization**: A sample array is initialized within the code to demonstrate the sorting process.
- **Displaying Sorted Array**: The program displays the sorted array after performing the Bubble Sort operation.

## Usage

To run this program, assemble and link the provided code using an appropriate assembler and linker compatible with x86 Assembly. Execute the resulting binary to see the sorting process and the sorted array displayed in the console.

## Instructions

- Assemble the code using a suitable x86 assembler.
- Link the assembled code to generate the executable.
- Run the generated executable to observe the Bubble Sort algorithm in action.

## Additional Notes

- **File Structure**: The repository includes the Assembly code file (`bubble_sort.asm`) showcasing the Bubble Sort implementation.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with x86 architecture and an appropriate assembler to run the code successfully.

Feel free to explore the code, modify the array, or integrate it into larger projects that require sorting functionalities using Assembly.
